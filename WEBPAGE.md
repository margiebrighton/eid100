<p>Although this is an assignment for EID 100 at Ryerson, I'd like to take a moment to praise a favourite musician of mine.
His name is Ron Sexsmith. Not only is he a wonderful singer and songwriter, but the man is blessed with a kind heart.
I encourage everyone to check out his music, if you haven't already. This is a picture of when I had the pleasure of 
meeting Ron at a recent concert.</p>
